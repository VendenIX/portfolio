    'about.big_description': "My interest in the digital world was sparked in my teenage years, as I sought to understand how websites, online transactions, and computers work. My self-taught explorations led me to the University of Caen, where I earned my bachelor's degree in computer science and got the opportunity to code my very first website. Currently, I am pursuing a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence, Data Analysis, and Health Access. This path was a deliberate decision to steer my future towards designing algorithms capable of improving medicine. Alongside my studies, I share my passion for music on my YouTube channel and participate in open-source projects. I am always on the lookout for learning opportunities and collaborations to carry out new projects. Always ready to work remotely, I am eager to contribute to open-source projects and continue learning in this exciting field.",
