        "description": "This project aims to create an API to utilize a deep learning algorithm specifically designed for the automatic segmentation of brain lesions on MRI images. In the context of cancer treatment via radiotherapy, healthcare professionals are required to manually outline the areas to be treated, a tedious and time-consuming task. A deep learning algorithm developed during a Master's internship at IDM Caen offers the possibility to perform this delineation automatically.\n\nI completed the deployment and finalization of the interface at the Fran√ßois Baclesse Center during an internship (27/05/2024 - 05/07/2024). Under the supervision of Dr. Corroyer-Dulmont, Head of AI and Medical Imaging Engineer at CFB, I contributed to the continuation of my annual Master 1 project to create a visualization interface and API that integrates this deep learning algorithm. My tasks included:\n\n- Deployment, finalization, and optimization of the interface based on OHIF Viewer and its API on the Windows environments of the center, involving ML Ops tasks (deployment of a deep learning solution)\n- Optimization of the deep learning model to reduce computational costs\n- Retraining the deep learning model on a new dataset\n\nSkills strengthened:\n\n- Analysis and manipulation of medical data in DICOM and NIFTII formats (MRI, CT-Scans)\n- R&D, autonomous problem-solving\n- Critical thinking\n- Understanding of deep learning models with complex neural architecture (UNET-R)\n- Multi-OS adaptation for deployment",

        "description": "My React Native Todo List application represents a pivotal moment in my coding journey as it marks my first foray into the world of React development. This project has been an exciting learning experience, as it provided me with valuable insights into building mobile applications using the React Native framework. One of the most significant accomplishments of this project was successfully integrating a database into the application. It was my maiden voyage in working with databases in a mobile app, and it taught me essential skills in managing data and leveraging the power of a database to store and retrieve information. As a newcomer to React, this project helped me grasp the core concepts and best practices of React development. It allowed me to understand the component-based architecture and the flow of data within a React application. Through the process of building the Todo List app, I gained confidence in using React to create responsive and interactive user interfaces. Moreover, this project also served as my introduction to working with RESTful APIs for performing CRUD operations. I learned how to interact with an API to send and receive data, enabling seamless communication between the front-end and the back-end. In summary, the React Native Todo List application is not just a simple task manager; it represents my first step into the world of React development and working with databases. It has been an invaluable learning experience, motivating me to explore and create more innovative and impactful projects in the future.",

        "description": "This project marks a significant milestone in my programming journey as it represents my first major undertaking. The Video Game Flora Generator has been an incredible learning experience, allowing me to hone my software design skills and delve into the world of 3D engine development. One of the most rewarding aspects was devising the algorithm to generate intricate fractal-based flora structures without relying on external resources, demonstrating my problem-solving abilities and creativity. While the project has been a challenging endeavor, particularly in realizing the 3D engine, it has been a gratifying journey of growth and exploration. Although the 3D version remains a work in progress, the foundation has been laid for future development and expansion. Moreover, this project also served as my introduction to object-oriented programming in Java, providing valuable insights into building modular and efficient code structures. It was an eye-opening experience that has paved the way for more ambitious projects in the future. In summary, the Video Game Flora Generator is a testament to my passion for programming and my willingness to take on challenges that push me beyond my comfort zone. It has significantly contributed to my development as a software developer and motivated me to continue exploring new frontiers in the world of game development and beyond.",

        "description": "\"Virus Infection Battle\" is a captivating game that offers a unique opportunity to observe the strategic showdown between two AI opponents utilizing Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithms at varying search depths. Players are immersed in a thrilling board game where the goal is to infect the opponent's territory with strategic moves. The game showcases the impact of search depth on AI decision-making, providing insights into how different levels of exploration influence gameplay outcomes. As players witness the AI agents battle it out, they can visualize the nodes explored and the number of iterations undertaken by each algorithm. \"Virus Infection Battle\" is a compelling experience that sheds light on the power of AI-driven strategies and their ability to navigate complex scenarios, ultimately leading to a greater understanding of the role of search depth in AI gameplay. Rules of the game are simple : Two players, Red and Blue, start with two tokens each on a 7x7 grid. Blue goes first. The winner is the one with more tokens at the end. The game ends when: 1. A player has no tokens left, 2. Both players pass, 3. The board repeats a state. On their turn, a player can clone or jump their token. Cloning places a new token one space away. Jumping moves a token two spaces, passing over others. If no move, they pass. Adjacent opponent tokens to a moved or cloned token turn to the active player's color. Then, the next player goes.",
